kOS scripts for Kerbal Space Program
---
I have to give heaping amounts of thanks and gratitude to Gaiiden and gisikw for making their code available for everyone. They are the core of how my missions are scripted. I hope to be able to contribute something to the community that will make playing KSP more fun for someone out there.

Despite objections to the contrary, the maths of orbital mechanics often escapes me (like a probe core on a 'Flea' SRB from Minmus). This means that there are some brute-force attempts to calculate values that are probably simple (for Wolfram-Alpha or MatLab) to reduce enough to function in kOS. If anyone sees something like this, and would like to correct me, please do! Open an issue, submit a pull request...
