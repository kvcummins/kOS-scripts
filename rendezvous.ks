// Verify target
//// Does it exist?
//// ship:body = target:body?
// Match inclination
//// Wait for Ascending/Descending Node
//// Burn at bisection angle until orbits coplanar
// Intercept target orbit (tangential intercept best)
//// Determine apsis to use
//// Burn retro/prograde until tangential intercept is made.
// Change orbit at intercept until a rendezvous is found
// Match target velocity at rendezvous
